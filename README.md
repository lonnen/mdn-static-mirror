MDN Static Mirror
-----------------

A project for creating and updating a static mirror of developer.mozilla.org content. Useful for setting up an air-gapped mirror of MDN without having to run the whole kuma/kumascript services stack.

The goal is to provide the mdn en-US content. It will not provide user accounts, history, other locales, or editing. This may change in the future.

This tight initial scope is set to support the needs of [The Last Mile](https://thelastmile.org/) training courses.
